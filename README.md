#### Basic Repo storing all my revisions (json and hex formats) for QMK toolbox.  

I am no longer going to use this repo to update my layouts. Before, I was using QMK online 
configurator that was limited but let me easily change my layout. Now that I am doing more 
custom stuff (and I finally debugged why it wouldn't work on my local machine) I am using the 
"normal" version of QMK. I have already created a custom OLED image to be used on my Lily58 pro. 
You can find my keymap and other features here https://github.com/DataDavD/qmk_firmware under 
keyboards/Lily58/keymaps/datadavd_lily58pro.

Currently, I am using the Lily58 pro with Zealios V2 lubed with Krytox 205g0 as my daily driver. I 
just switched from my first mechanical keeb, the Iris rev4, with unlubed Cherry MX Brown 
switches, so the new Lily58 with the lubed Zealios is miles away better. I intend to build 5 
Alice style keebs in 2021, so follow this repo for more keeb and layout updates.

Many thanks to the mechanical keyboard community on Reddit and Discord. Everyone has been very kind
in answering all my newb questions as I feel every so deep into the rabbit hole (and continue to 
do so).
