#### Basic Repo storing all my revisions (json and hex formats) for QMK toolbox.  

Currenly, using the Iris rev4 as my daily driver, but intend to build a low profile Iris rev4 with
Kaihl Choc Brown switches and MBK Choc keycaps. 

I also have Lily58 pro in the works with hot swap sockets for both MX and Choc style switches which
I believe will be my daily driver because it sits naturally lower than the Iris while still
 allowing me to use MX style switches and keycaps which I have grown to love coming from the
  Logitech K811 (which is actually a great bluetooth keyboard IMHO).
