#### Basic Repo storing all my revisions (json and hex formats) for QMK toolbox.  

Currently, I am using the Lily58 pro with Zealios V2 lubed with Krytox 205g0 as my daily driver. I 
just switched from my first mechanical keeb, the Iris rev4, with unlubed Cherry MX Brown 
switches, so the new Lily58 with the lubed Zealios is miles away better. I intend to build 5 
Alice style keebs in 2021, so follow this repo for more keeb and layout updates.

Many thanks to the mechanical keyboard community on Reddit and Discord. Everyone has been very kind
in answering all my newb questions as I feel every so deep into the rabbit hole (and continue to 
do so).
